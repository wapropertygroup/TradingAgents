"""Company statements as they were filed, from SEC EDGAR.

Every other fundamentals vendor serves a period's current value and cuts the
statement at the fiscal period end. That is two claims a run should not make: a
period that has ended is not public until the company files, weeks later, and a
figure that was later restated is not what investors saw at the time.

EDGAR reports every fact with the date it was filed, so a run dated ``as_of_date``
serves exactly what was on file by then, restatements included at the vintage
that was current: Apple's 2008 total assets read 39.6B until the 2010 amendment
restated them to 36.2B.

Access needs no key or account, only a User-Agent identifying the caller, which
SEC requires and refuses requests without. US filers only: anything absent from
EDGAR's ticker map falls through to the next configured vendor.
