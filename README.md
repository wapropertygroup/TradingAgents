## TradingAgents Framework

TradingAgents is a multi-agent trading framework that mirrors the dynamics of real-world trading firms. By deploying specialized LLM-powered agents: from fundamental analysts, sentiment experts, and technical analysts, to trader, risk management team, the platform collaboratively evaluates market conditions and informs trading decisions. Moreover, these agents engage in dynamic discussions to pinpoint the optimal strategy.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/schema.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</p>

> TradingAgents framework is designed for research purposes. Trading performance may vary based on many factors, including the chosen backbone language models, model temperature, trading periods, the quality of data, and other non-deterministic factors. [It is not intended as financial, investment, or trading advice.](https://tauric.ai/disclaimer/)

Our framework decomposes complex trading tasks into specialized roles.

### Analyst Team
- Fundamentals Analyst: Evaluates company financials and performance metrics, identifying intrinsic values and potential red flags.
- Sentiment Analyst: Aggregates news headlines, StockTwits, and Reddit chatter into a single sentiment read to gauge short-term market mood.
- News Analyst: Monitors global news and macroeconomic indicators, interpreting the impact of events on market conditions.
- Technical Analyst: Utilizes technical indicators (like MACD and RSI) to detect trading patterns and forecast price movements.
- Earnings & Estimate Revision Analyst (**opt-in**): Reads the *direction* of analyst consensus rather than its level — how far consensus EPS has moved over 7/30/90 days, how many analysts moved it each way, the surprise record, and post-earnings drift. See [Earnings Analyst](#earnings-analyst) below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/analyst.png" width="100%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Researcher Team
- Comprises both bullish and bearish researchers who critically assess the insights provided by the Analyst Team. Through structured debates, they balance potential gains against inherent risks.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/researcher.png" width="70%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Trader Agent
- Composes reports from the analysts and researchers to make informed trading decisions, determining the timing and magnitude of trades.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/trader.png" width="70%" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 2%;">
</p>

### Risk Management and Portfolio Manager
- Continuously evaluates portfolio risk by assessing market volatility, liquidity, and other risk factors. The risk management team evaluates and adjusts trading strategies, providing assessment reports to the Portfolio Manager for final decision.
- The Portfolio Manager approves/rejects the transaction proposal. If approved, the order will be sent to the simulated exchange and executed.

## Installation and CLI

### Installation

Clone TradingAgents:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents.git
cd TradingAgents
```

Create a virtual environment in any of your favorite environment managers:
```bash
conda create -n tradingagents python=3.12
conda activate tradingagents
```

Install the package and its dependencies:
```bash
pip install .
```

### Docker

Alternatively, run with Docker:
```bash
cp .env.example .env  # add your API keys
docker compose run --rm tradingagents
```

For local models with Ollama:
```bash
docker compose --profile ollama run --rm tradingagents-ollama
```

### Required APIs

TradingAgents supports multiple LLM providers. Set the API key for your chosen provider:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...          # OpenAI (GPT)
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=...          # Google (Gemini)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...       # Anthropic (Claude)
export XAI_API_KEY=...             # xAI (Grok)
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...        # DeepSeek
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=...       # Qwen — International (dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com)
export DASHSCOPE_CN_API_KEY=...    # Qwen — China (dashscope.aliyuncs.com)
export ZHIPU_API_KEY=...           # GLM via Z.AI (international)
export ZHIPU_CN_API_KEY=...        # GLM via BigModel (China, open.bigmodel.cn)
export MINIMAX_API_KEY=...         # MiniMax — Global (api.minimax.io)
export MINIMAX_CN_API_KEY=...      # MiniMax — China (api.minimaxi.com)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...      # OpenRouter
export ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=...   # Alpha Vantage
```

For Azure OpenAI, copy `.env.enterprise.example` to `.env.enterprise` and fill in your credentials.

For AWS Bedrock, install the extra with `pip install ".[bedrock]"`, set `llm_provider: "bedrock"`, configure AWS credentials (environment variables, `~/.aws/credentials`, or an IAM role) and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, and use a Bedrock model ID, e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8-v1:0`.

For local models, configure Ollama with `llm_provider: "ollama"`. The default endpoint is `http://localhost:11434/v1`; set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to point at a remote `ollama-serve`. Pull models with `ollama pull <name>`, and pick "Custom model ID" in the CLI for any model not listed by default.

For any other OpenAI-compatible server (vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp, or a custom relay), use `llm_provider: "openai_compatible"` and set the endpoint via `backend_url` (or `TRADINGAGENTS_LLM_BACKEND_URL`), e.g. `http://localhost:8000/v1` for vLLM or `http://localhost:1234/v1` for LM Studio. The model is whatever your server serves. No key is needed for local servers; set `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` when the endpoint requires one.

Alternatively, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### CLI Usage

Launch the interactive CLI:
```bash
tradingagents          # installed command
python -m cli.main     # alternative: run directly from source
```
You will see a screen where you can select your desired tickers, analysis date, LLM provider, research depth, and more.

### Markets and tickers

TradingAgents works with any market Yahoo Finance covers, using the exchange-suffixed ticker. Company identity and the alpha benchmark resolve automatically per market.

- US: `AAPL`, `SPY`
- Hong Kong: `0700.HK` · Tokyo: `7203.T` · London: `AZN.L`
- India: `RELIANCE.NS`, `.BO` · Canada: `.TO` · Australia: `.AX`
- China A-shares: Shanghai `.SS`, Shenzhen `.SZ` (e.g. `600519.SS` for Kweichow Moutai)
- Crypto: `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`

## TradingAgents Package

### Implementation Details

We built TradingAgents with LangGraph to ensure flexibility and modularity. The framework supports multiple LLM providers: OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek, Qwen (Alibaba DashScope, international and China endpoints), GLM (Zhipu), MiniMax (global + China), OpenRouter, Ollama for local models, and Azure OpenAI for enterprise.

### Python Usage

To use TradingAgents inside your code, you can import the `tradingagents` module and initialize a `TradingAgentsGraph()` object. The `.propagate()` function will return a decision. You can run `main.py`, here's also a quick example:

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy())

# forward propagate
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-01-15")
print(decision)
```

You can also adjust the default configuration to set your own choice of LLMs, debate rounds, etc.

```python
from tradingagents.graph.trading_graph import TradingAgentsGraph
from tradingagents.default_config import DEFAULT_CONFIG

config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["llm_provider"] = "openai"        # e.g. openai, google, anthropic, deepseek, groq, ollama; openai_compatible covers any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp, ...)
config["deep_think_llm"] = "gpt-5.5"     # Model for complex reasoning
config["quick_think_llm"] = "gpt-5.4-mini" # Model for quick tasks
config["max_debate_rounds"] = 2

ta = TradingAgentsGraph(debug=True, config=config)
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-01-15")
print(decision)
```

See `tradingagents/default_config.py` for all configuration options.

## Earnings Analyst

The Earnings & Estimate Revision Analyst is **opt-in**. The default analyst
selection is unchanged, so upgrading adds no API key requirement, no extra
provider call, and no extra LLM cost to an existing run.

```python
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(
    selected_analysts=["market", "social", "news", "fundamentals", "earnings"],
    config=config,
)
```

In the CLI it appears as a checkbox, "Earnings & Estimate Revision Analyst", for
stock tickers. It is filtered out for crypto alongside the Fundamentals Analyst.

### What it reports

Everything numeric is computed by code from provider data and rendered directly
into the report; the language model only adds guidance, catalysts, risks and data
gaps, and cannot alter a figure or the momentum band.

| Field | yfinance (default) | Alpha Vantage (opt-in) | 同花顺 (A-share fallback) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Consensus EPS, by period | yes | yes (premium endpoint) | yes, per fiscal year |
| EPS trend at 7 / 30 / 60 / 90 days | yes | yes (premium endpoint) | no — accrues locally |
| Analyst up/down revision counts | 7d, 30d | 7d, 30d | no |
| 90-day revision counts | **no** | **no** | no |
| Analyst coverage count | yes | yes | yes (预测机构数) |
| Consensus revenue | yes | yes (premium endpoint) | no |
| Revenue revision history | **no** — accrues locally | yes (premium endpoint) | no |
| Next earnings date | yes | yes | no |
| Release timing (before/after market) | **no** | yes | no |
| Announcement dates | scrape only, often fails | yes | no |
| Surprise history | yes | yes | no |
| Post-earnings drift (+1/+5/+20/+60 sessions) | needs announcement dates | yes | no |
| Earnings-call transcript | no | yes (premium endpoint) | no |
| Whisper expectations | **no source** | **no source** | **no source** |
| Consensus margin revisions | **no source** | **no source** | **no source** |

Momentum is a weighted mean of the revision signals that are actually present,
renormalized over available weight, banded as Strong Positive / Positive /
Neutral / Negative / Strong Negative. When too few signals exist the band is
**Insufficient Data** — a statement about coverage, not a neutral verdict on the
company. A field with no source is rendered "unavailable" with the reason; it is
never zero, and the prompt forbids the model from filling it in.

Percentage changes are **symmetric** — `2(new−old)/(|new|+|old|)` — not ordinary
percentage change, which divides by zero at `old == 0` and inverts sign when
`old < 0`. Yahoo's own `growth` column has that sign bug and is ignored: a loss
narrowing from −2.61 to −2.44 is an upgrade, and ordinary change calls it a
downgrade.

### Point-in-time limitation

**A historical `trade_date` is answered from stored snapshots or not at all.**
Nothing upstream sells back last month's consensus — Yahoo's lookbacks are
relative to *now*, so asked on a later date they describe a later window. Filling
a past date with today's figures would be a future function that is invisible
downstream, because the numbers look exactly like a measurement taken then.

So every run appends a dated observation to `earnings_snapshots.sqlite3` under
your configured `data_cache_dir`, and a historical run reads the newest
observation dated at or before the requested date. Before the first run there are
no vintages, and such a request reports `pit_unavailable` rather than guessing.

That store also fills horizons the vendors do not publish at all — Yahoo's
revenue revisions, and every horizon for A-shares — so a symbol analysed
regularly grows a real revision history locally. Each such value carries its
true age, and a vintage too old for its slot is refused rather than stretched.
A single vintage is not enough to earn a band: the 30-day slot alone is 0.35 of
the signal weight, under the 0.50 floor, so a 同花顺-only A-share reports
Insufficient Data until roughly a month of runs has filled both the 7- and
30-day slots.

The file is a local cache of an unrecoverable series: a code rollback may leave
it unused, but do not delete it expecting it to be refetched.

### Provider configuration

```python
config["data_vendors"]["earnings_data"] = "yfinance,a_stock"   # default
config["data_vendors"]["earnings_data"] = "alpha_vantage,yfinance,a_stock"
config["data_vendors"]["earnings_commentary"] = "alpha_vantage" # needs a key
```

`yfinance` leads by default — the reverse of the four core chains, where
`a_stock` leads. Yahoo publishes a real revision history for every venue it
covers, A-shares in Yahoo form (`600519.SS`) included, in CNY. The hazard that
puts `a_stock` first elsewhere does not apply here: this adapter refuses a bare
six-digit code by string inspection with no network call and raises on an unknown
symbol, so it cannot answer emptily and stop the chain. Adding `alpha_vantage`
buys real announcement dates and release timing, which is what post-earnings
drift needs; its estimate and transcript endpoints are premium, and on a free key
they degrade to a stated data gap rather than failing the run.

## Persistence and Recovery

TradingAgents persists two kinds of state across runs.

### Decision log

The decision log is always on. Each completed run appends its decision to `~/.tradingagents/memory/trading_memory.md`. On the next run for the same ticker, TradingAgents fetches the realised return (raw and alpha vs SPY), generates a one-paragraph reflection, and injects the most recent same-ticker decisions plus recent cross-ticker lessons into the Portfolio Manager prompt, so each analysis carries forward what worked and what didn't.

Override the path with `TRADINGAGENTS_MEMORY_LOG_PATH`.

### Checkpoint resume

Checkpoint resume is opt-in via `--checkpoint`. When enabled, LangGraph saves state after each node so a crashed or interrupted run resumes from the last successful step instead of starting over. On a resume run you will see `Resuming from step N for <TICKER> on <date>` in the logs; on a new run you will see `Starting fresh`. Checkpoints are cleared automatically on successful completion.

Per-ticker SQLite databases live at `~/.tradingagents/cache/checkpoints/<TICKER>.db` (override the base with `TRADINGAGENTS_CACHE_DIR`). Use `--clear-checkpoints` to reset all of them before a run.

```bash
tradingagents analyze --checkpoint           # enable for this run
tradingagents analyze --clear-checkpoints    # reset before running
```

```python
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["checkpoint_enabled"] = True
ta = TradingAgentsGraph(config=config)
_, decision = ta.propagate("NVDA", "2026-01-15")
```

## Reproducibility

TradingAgents is LLM-driven, so two runs of the same ticker and date can differ. This is expected for a research tool built on language models, not a defect. The variation comes from a few distinct sources, and it helps to separate them.

Language model sampling is non-deterministic. Even at a fixed temperature, providers do not guarantee byte-identical output across calls, and reasoning models (the default GPT-5.x family, and any thinking-mode model) vary the most because their internal reasoning is itself sampled.

Live data moves. News, StockTwits, and Reddit return different content as time passes, so a run today sees different inputs than a run last week even for the same historical trade date. Pin the analysis date to hold the price and indicator window fixed, but the social and news sources still reflect "now".

To reduce variation you can lower the sampling temperature. Set `temperature` in your config (or `TRADINGAGENTS_TEMPERATURE` in `.env`); lower values make models that honor it more repeatable. The current curated models are reasoning-first and largely ignore temperature, so for tighter reproducibility use a non-reasoning model, which you can set explicitly via the Custom model ID option.

```python
config = DEFAULT_CONFIG.copy()
config["llm_provider"] = "openai"
config["temperature"] = 0.0
# Reasoning models ignore temperature. For tighter reproducibility, set a
# non-reasoning deep/quick model explicitly (e.g. via the Custom model ID option).
```

What does not vary anymore: the analyzed company identity is resolved deterministically from the ticker before any agent runs, and the market analyst grounds exact price and indicator claims in a verified data snapshot. Earlier reports of "different companies" or fabricated price levels across runs are addressed by these two mechanisms.

Backtest results are not guaranteed to match any published figure. Returns depend on the model, the temperature, the date range, data quality, and the sampling above. Treat the framework as a research scaffold for studying multi-agent analysis, not as a strategy with a fixed, replicable return.
